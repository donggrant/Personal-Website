				<h4><a href="https://cs.virginia.edu/~mhm9mm/userTest/login.php">Major League Baseball Statistics Website</a></h4>
				<p>
					I developed a website that stores MLB stats for all players and teams during the 2019 season. At the creation 
					of this website, I decided to avoid abnormal data from current season results because of the pandemic. 
					On the website, users must first create an account to access all of its functions. Once registered, users can 
					sort and find MLB players and teams, and additionally favorite specific players and teams to keep better
					track of them. I used SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for this project.

				<h4><a href="https://mdmv.herokuapp.com/">Donations and Volunteering Platform</a></h4>
				<p>
					I developed an online charity platform that serves as both a donations and volunteering platform.
					For one function, users can post donations or donate to charities and causes of their choice. In the 
					other function, users can post volunteering events and other users can browse and sign up to volunteer 
					for those causes. During the development of the website, I utilized Python, Bootstrap, 
					the Stripe payment API, and the Django framework.

				<h4>SmartLife Application Development</h4>
				<p>
					In this project, I worked with 4 other partners in a front-end application emphasizing user design 
					and development. I was the design lead of the group. I produced a productivity and lifestyle app 
					targeted to students to make academic life more efficient. Throughout the project, I conducted a lot 
					of interviews with people and research on user experience and how to create an application that best 
					suits the needs of college students. I was able to get familiar with many design tools like Figma and 
					the overall professional UX design process.
