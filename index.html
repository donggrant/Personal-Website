				Venture on to learn more about me beyond what is on my resume.
			</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				I am a 4th year undergraduate student, currently 21 years old, and I am cherishing the last year I have living
				a college life. I am currently on the search for an internship or full-time role in the
				fields of software engineering and data science. Overall, I am seeking the opportunity 
				to get more exposure to the world of computer science and technology. I still very much 
				consider myself a beginner in the vast ocean of that is the technological field. I am constantly searching for 
				hand’s on experiences in my fields of interest for my own personal edification and a 
				future where I can make a valuable impact in the world of technoloy. Most importantly, 
				I strive to learn!
