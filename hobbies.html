                <h4>Black Belt Martial Artist</h4>
                <p>
                    I am a second degree black belt in Taekwondoe, the traditional Korean form of martial arts.
                    I studied at the American Taekwondo Association, which has many branches across the United States.
                    I've competed at multiple tournaments and have won first place in my division for sparring, and 
                    second in weapons. Though I love martial arts, I still consider what I do a sport, and not a 
                    practical use of self defense, so don't go using me as your body guard. I probably won't be that helpful.

                <h4>Casual Musician</h4>
                <p>
                    I am a self-learning piano and viola player. I use to play the piano competitively as a child, but 
                    I don't have pleasant memories of those times because of all the pressure that came with competitive 
                    piano playing back then. Now I've grown to get back into touching the keyboard and just playing for fun. 
                    Whenever I have free time, I would find myself sitting down at my keyboard and trying to learn new songs 
                    that have recently caught my interest. Playing the piano makes me feel relaxed and helps me a lot on my 
                    stressful days.

                <h4>Fitness</h4>
                <p>
                    Frequently in my free time I will be engaging in some sort of fitness to at least keep myself  
                    somewhat healthy. I really like to jog and it is also my go-to form of exercise. I also know 
                    and enjoy how to swim. Recently, I've also been getting a gym routine going where I started a 
                    weight training goal to build more muscle.
