				<h4>The Mitre Corporation - Data Science Internship</h4>
                <h5>January 2021 - August 2021</h5>
				<p>
					In 2021, I worked at Mitre for both the Winter and Summer seasons. My main accomplishment
                    this time around is creating an automatic annotator for FAA flight data. I improved upon 
                    older algorithms that relied heavily on automatic speech recognition. The major weaknesses
                    of such ASR approaches is that most of the mass amount of FAA flight audio is of poor quality. 
                    Therefore, by utilizing time stamps and other relational data from non-voice sources like 
                    departure and arrival times, and hand-off messages, I was able to significanlty improve
                    the accuracy of the flight annotator, as well as increase its speed and efficiency.Throughout 
                    my time working on the annotator, most of my work was done in Python. I managed, manipulated, 
                    and analyzed lots of data through HDFS architecture and the PySpark framework

				<h4>The Mitre Corporation - Software Engineering Internship</h4>
                <h5>May 2020 - August 2020</h5>
				<p>
					At Mitre, I worked with a division focusing on the logistics of expanding commercial 
                    drone usage and examining the potential risks of extending drone flights into different 
                    areas of the country. In my direct line of work, I developed a user interface for their  
                    commercial drone risk analysis software using java and its GUI library, and python scripts. 
                    During my internship, I worked a lot with big data air traffic files and optimized efficiency 
                    and run time of the drone software by connecting it with Mitre’s computer cluster. Overall, my
                    work really helped streamline the process of the drone risk evaluation process and made it more 
                    accessible to people of non-technical backgrounds at Mitre.

				<h4>Hua Xia Chinese School Administrative Assistant</h4>
                <h5>September 2015 - June 2018</h5>
				<p>
					Hua Xia is an organization that specializes in teaching American students 
                    the Chinese language and culture. This was my first working experience, and I
                    learned to develop a good work ethic and acquired leadership practice along the
                    way. While working here, I mentored as a teaching assistant in multiple classes 
                    where I got to work with young students varying from ages 6 to 13. For the
                    other half of the job when my classes were not in session, I managed papers and 
                    documents for all the teachers in the school and ran small administrative errands 
                    to help make the faculty there work more efficiently.
